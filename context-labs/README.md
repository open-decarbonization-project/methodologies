# The Context Labs Methodology

Context Labs is an enterprise technology company dedicated to sourcing, organizing, contextualizing, and securing the
world’s climate information. The company enables trust in data, which can be utilized to inform markets. We synthesize
disparate, disconnected data from all available data sources — including satellites, aerial flyovers, ground sensors,
and other operational assets — to establish a more holistic understanding of ground truth carbon intensity for
industrial operations. Data is ingested, contextualized, interconnected, and secured immutably using a combination of
advanced graph analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies—making climate disclosures fully
auditable and impossible to manipulate.

Recognizing the critical importance of eliminating anthropogenic methane emissions, this quantification methodology was
developed using several years of R&D and has been tested in the market. This trusted emissions data supports the
production of trusted environmental attributes with provenance direct to the source. Our near-real time emissions
quantification is being used by leaders in the natural gas industry to support their decarbonization efforts. Context
Labs’ intent is to inspire the development of other emissions quantification methodologies that could also be applied
using their AI-enabled data fabric platform for at-scale decarbonization of industrial operations.
