# About Context Labs Methodology

Recognizing the critical importance of eliminating anthropogenic methane emissions, Context Labs has initially contributed the enclosed Emissions Quantification Methodology for the generation of Asset-Grade Environmental Assets. This near-real time emissions quantification approach is being used by leaders in the oil & gas value chain to support and accelerate their decarbonization efforts. This methodology was developed using years of R&D and has been tested in the market at scale. This trusted emissions data supports the production of trusted environmental attributes with provenance direct to the source.

Context Labs is an enterprise technology company dedicated to sourcing, organizing, contextualizing, and securing the world’s climate information. The company enables trust in data, which can be utilized to inform markets. We synthesize disparate, disconnected data from all available data sources — including satellites, aerial flyovers, ground sensors, and other operational assets — to establish a more holistic understanding of ground truth carbon intensity for industrial operations. Data is ingested, contextualized, interconnected, and secured immutably using a combination of advanced graph analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies—making climate disclosures fully auditable and preventing misrepresentation.
